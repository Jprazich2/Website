![The story of my semester](/blog/2020-05-15-post-one_files/covid19.jpg)

This is where I'm going to show working python code and going between R and python code.



```{python}
#This is python code

x = [0,1,3,5,6,10,4,6,3,7,8,3,2,6,0]
y = [2,3,6,3,6,8,4,2,1,4,9,2,3,6,1]

yplus1=[] #create empty list
for i in range(len(y)):
  yplus1.append(y[i]+1)
  
print(yplus1)
```

```{r}
# This is R code
library(reticulate)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot() + geom_point(aes(py$x, py$yplus1))

```

```{python}
# Back to python
import re

string = "Test this ability to import packages"

re.match("Test", string)

newstring = "1245, 3468, 3235, 5576"

re.findall("^1.{3}", newstring)

re.findall(".{3}6$", newstring)

```
